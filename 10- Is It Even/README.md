# Is It Even

##  Description of the Program

**Is It Even** program allows the user to enter a number and checks if the number it is even or odd using a function **string checkEven(int num)**.
- Take an integer as input.
- Checks if the number can be divided by 2.
-Returns the a string saying whether the number is **even or odd**.

The actual progarm asks the user for a number then  calls the **checkEven()** function and displays the result on the Output.


##  How to Run the Program

1. **Open VS Code** and find the project folder named **Programming Skills Portfolio**    

2. **Open the terminal** (`Ctrl + `` or View → Terminal`)  

3. **Compile the file** by typing:
g++ IsItEven.cpp -o IsItEven

## Execute Program

- On Windows:
.\IsItEven.exe

Even number: If the user enter`s number 10 the provided number is **even**.

Odd number: If the user enter`s number 7 the provided number is **odd**.


##  What I Learned
- To create a function that returns a value.
- How to pass data to a function using parameters.
- Use modules operator (%) to be able to check **even and odd numbers**.
- Store the returned value in a variable.
- How to display result using **cout**.

## Academic Integrity
I used ChatGpt only as a study tool to help me understand the task requirements and the related programming concepts.  
The final code was all written and completd by me.
