### Execute Program
- On Windows:
.\PrimitiveQuiz.exe

- On macOS/Linux:
./PrimitiveQuiz


### What i learned in this Progarm
- How to use the int main() function to structure the program.
- How to use **#include <iostream>** for input and output commands such as cout and cin.
- veriying conditions using **if and else**.
- Reading full answers using **getline**.
