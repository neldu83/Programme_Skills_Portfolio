# Brute Force Attack

## Description of the Program
This program simulates a basic brute force password attack.
The correct password **12345** is hard coded into the program , and the user must attempt to guess it.


- Prompts/tells the user to enter the password.
- Uses a while loop that gives repeated attempts to the user .
- It checks if each attempts matches the correct password. that is hard coded into the program.
- Stops straight away once the correct password in entered.
- The user has only 5 attempts.
- After 5 attempts, it will display a warning telling the user that authorities have been alerted.

## How to Run the program 
- Open the terminal ( Ctrl + `` or view Terminal ).
- Compile file by typing g++ 
BruteForceAttack.cpp  
-0 BruteForceAttack



## Execute Program
- On Windows:
.\BruteForceAttack.exe
 
- On macOS/Linux:   
./BruteForceAttack

## Output Example 

- The user enters a five digits password                  wth only ( **5 attempts left** ) and try to get the right password during the attempts listed above.

If all five attempts are incorrect the terminal will display the following message: **Too many failed attempts, the authorities have been alerted!.**

## What I learned
- How to use a while loop to repeat actions until a condition is met.
- How to tarck the number of attempts using a counter.

## Academic Integrity
I used ChatGpt only as a study tool to help me understand the task requirements and the related programming concepts.  
The final code and was all written and completd by me.
