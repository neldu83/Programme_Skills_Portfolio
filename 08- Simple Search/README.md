## Description 

**Simple Search**
This program allows the users to search for a specific name within a predefined list of names. 
It demonstrates the use of **arrays** meaning a list, **loops**, **string comparison**, and **conditional logic** to find and display whether a name exists in the list.
- The program displays all available names. 
- Accepts user input using **getline()**
- Loops through the list to find the name.
- Displays the index position if the name is found. 
- Shows a **not found** message if the search fails.

## How to Run the Program
- Open VS Code and find the project folder named **Programming Skills Portfolio**    
- Open the terminal ( Ctrl + `` or view Terminal ).  
- Compile file by typing g++ SimpleSearch.cpp  
-0 SimpleSearch


## Execute Program

- On Windows:
.\SimpleSearch.exe

- On macOS/Linux:
./SimpleSearch

## Outout Example

Example 1: **Name Found**
- Available names: Sienna, Scarlett, Samantha, Nelson, Rui
- Enter a name to search for: **Nelson** 
- Name: **Nelson** found in the  position **3!**

Example 2: **Name not Found**
- Available names: Sienna, Scarlett, Samantha, Nelson, Rui
- Enter a name to search for: **Bety**
- Name: **Bety** not found in the list.

## What I Learned 
- How to store multiple values using an array.
How to use a for loop to **iterate** meaning go through items one by one from start to end.
- How to compare strings using == in C++.
- Using boolean flag **found** to verify weather a match exists
- How to use **getline(cin, ...) to read full string inputs.

## Academic Integrity
I used ChatGpt only as a study tool to help me understand the task requirements and the related programming concepts.  
The final code was written and completd by me.
