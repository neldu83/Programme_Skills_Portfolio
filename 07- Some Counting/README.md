# Some Counting 

## Description of the Programe
The Some Counting program shows the user how to use for loops to perform diffirent counting tasks.
Prints several numbers sequences.
- Countimg from 0 to 50 
- Counting backwards from 50 to 0
- Counting from 30 to 50
- Counting backwards from 50 to 10 in steps of 2
- Counting from 100 to 200 in steps of 5 

## How to Run the Program
- Open VS Code and find the project folder named **Programming Skills Portfolio**    
- Open the terminal ( Ctrl + `` or view Terminal ).  
- Compile file by typing g++ SomeCounting.cpp  
-0 SomeCounting

### Execute Program

- On Windows:
.\SomeCounting.exe

- On macOS/Linux:
./SomeCounting

## What I learned 
- How to use **for loops to repeat actions a specific number of times.
- How to count **upwards and downwards** by changing loop conditions.
- How to use diffirent step sizes using **i++ , i-- , and i += x .**

## Summary 
This program helped me to understand how loop control and variables work and how to increase or decrease numbers.

## Academic Integrity
I used ChatGpt only as a study tool to help me understand the task requirements and the related programming concepts.  
The final code was all written and completd by me.
