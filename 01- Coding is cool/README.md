# Coding is cool
### Description of the Program
The program prints the message **Coding is cool** to the console.
I created this program using basic C++ Syntax  **The rules of programming language** and output statements that I have learned during the Code Lab 1 lesson
This really helped me to understand how a C++ program is structured and also gave more confidence using Visual Studio code and the terminal to build and run my own programs.

### What I Learned on this program


- How to create and structure a basic C++ program using the left parenthesis and right parenthesis brackets () function.
- The purpose of `#include <iostream>` - to use input/ output commands like `cout`.
- How to use `cout` to show text in the console and end lines using `endl`.
- The meaning of `return 0;` and how it tells us that the program finished successfully.
- Use `string` variables to store text and troubleshooting small syntax issues.
- Combine text and numbers in `cout`.
- Write mult-line console output.
