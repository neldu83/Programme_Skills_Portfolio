# Simple Sums 

**Description of the Program**
This program demonstrates variables declaration, arithmetic operations, and console output.  
It creates Integer variables with fixed values ( 8 and 10 ), adds them together using a third variable and prints the result to the screen. 


## How it Runs 

1. The program declares three integer variables  in C++

- `a` is set to **8**
- `b` is set to **10**
- `sum` stores the result of `a + b` 
2. The program prints the sum to the console using the `cout`.   

3. No user input is required.

## How to Run the Program
- Open VS Code and find the project folder named **Programming Skills Portfolio**    
- Open the terminal ( Ctrl + `` or view Terminal ).  
- Compile file by typing g++SimpleSums.cpp -o SimpleSums

## Execute Program

- On Windows:  
.\SimpleSums.exe 

- On macOS /Linux:  
./SimpleSums 

## What I learned

- How to declare and initialise integer variables in C++
- How to perform simple arithmetic operations
- How to output text and values using cout 
- Basic structure of a C++ program (main(), return value, etc.)

## Academic Integrity
I used ChatGpt only as a study tool to help me understand the task requirements and the related programming concepts.
The final code and all written work were completd by me.
